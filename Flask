It looks like you're setting up a Flask server within a Docker container! Hereâ€™s a recap of what you need to do:

1. **Update `entrypoint.py`:** Replace the contents with the provided code, ensuring it sets up two POST endpoints (`/record` and `/collect`).

   ```python
   # import the flask web framework
   from flask import Flask

   # create a Flask server, and allow us to interact with it using the app variable
   app = Flask(__name__)

   # define an endpoint which accepts POST requests, and is reachable from the /record endpoint
   @app.route('/record', methods=['POST'])
   def record_engine_temperature():
       # return a json payload, and a 200 status code to the client
       return {"success": True}, 200

   # practically identical to the above
   @app.route('/collect', methods=['POST'])
   def collect_engine_temperature():
       return {"success": True}, 200
   ```

2. **Modify the Dockerfile:** Update the CMD line to use Gunicorn. It should look something like this:

   ```dockerfile
   CMD exec gunicorn entrypoint:app
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Image:** Use the following commands:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your_image_name .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 your_image_name
   ```

4. **Check the Logs:** After running the container, you should see output logs indicating that the Flask app is running, typically showing something like:

   ```
   [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.x.x
   [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000 (20xx)
   ```

Once everything is set up, you can send POST requests to `http://localhost:8000/record` and `http://localhost:8000/collect` to see the success responses.

If you encounter any issues, check the logs for errors, and consult the Flask documentation for troubleshooting. Let me know if you need further assistance!
